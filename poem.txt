A Poem for Issue Seven

In circuits deep and code compiled,
A test issue stood, both brief and mild.
"Do nothing," said the task at hand,
"Just write a poem, simple and grand."

So here among the pull requests,
Where logic flows and syntax rests,
A moment's pause from bug and fix —
A poem woven between the clicks.

No files to change, no bugs to chase,
Just words arranged in quiet grace.
A gentle proof that even code
Can stop and smell the verse bestowed.
