A Poem for Issue Nine

In circuits deep and code refined,
A test issue came, of simple kind.
"Do nothing much," the request did say,
"Just write a poem to brighten the day."

So here it stands, in plaintext grace,
A few short lines to fill this space.
No bugs to fix, no features grand,
Just words arranged as someone planned.

The pull request will come and go,
The CI checks will pass (we hope so).
And when the merge at last is done,
This little poem will have had its run.
