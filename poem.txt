A Poem for Issue Nine

In circuits deep and code refined,
A test issue came, of simple kind.
"Do nothing much," the request did say,
"Just write a poem to brighten the day."

So here it stands, in plaintext grace,
A few short lines to fill this space.
No bugs to fix, no features grand,
Just words arranged as someone planned.
