A Poem for Issue Nine

In circuits deep and code refined,
A test issue came, of simple kind.
"Do nothing much," the request did say,
"Just write a poem to brighten the day."

So here it stands, in plaintext grace,
A few short lines to fill this space.
No bugs to fix, no features grand,
Just words arranged as someone planned.

Through branches forked and merges clean,
The finest workflow ever seen.
A commit message, short and true,
Says "fix #9" — and that will do.

The reviewer reads with careful eye,
And asks for more — we shall comply.
For poetry, like code, can grow,
With every push, a better flow.

In open source we find our song,
A community where all belong.
Each issue opened, each PR made,
Is one more step in the parade.

The pull request will come and go,
The CI checks will pass (we hope so).
And when the merge at last is done,
This little poem will have had its run.
